I am sorry to say that I submit an incomplete project. I have not 
cropped the images from 6.png as suggested. Still for the means of the 
project I picked react for a couple of reasons:
	1) I know you guys you react
	2) Even though I am not familiar with it I still picked it 
because this way you can see my learning curve
	3) I think it provides us with a fairly easy way of building a 
component-based app

I know most of code is not highly efficient or maybe an example of how 
not to do things, for which I am deeply sorry, but due to an unexpected 
trip I had to take I was left with short period of time. You can still 
see the partially made tutorial.

P.S. To trigger the next step of the tutorial I made the current 
text-input has to lose focus(blur).
