Apart from the content analyzer, for a spell-checking feature I think 
the following solution should do well:
	Gather text from all parts we want to be checked and for each 
word make sure that a already formed dictionary contains it. If not then 
the word is incorrectly spelled. It might even be made as an autocorrect 
feature. If it is implemented as an autocorrect I suggest having a 
switch to be added to so people can turn it off if they do not wish to 
use it. Also the dictionary should be sorted alphabetically by all means 
so the spell-checking can be done faster.
