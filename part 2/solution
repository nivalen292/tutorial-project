A couple of solutions come to mind when given a certain task. 
	For starters if all of the context is strictly pulled from a 
database, a simple page "pull" page can be made. In other words, creating a suitable 
UI for non-techies to pull or even push data into the database.
	If there are data parts that are static and not stored somewhere 
and non-techies want to edit them, I suggest a simple template to be 
made and do everthing mentioned above in order to change the template 
and not the data.
	The benefits of these methods are that both developers and 
non-techies can edit the data. Another asset is that this "pull" page, 
if done right, can be used not only in 1 project but in multiple. 
However, it might take some time before fully completing it but in my 
opinion it is a worthy investment of time.
